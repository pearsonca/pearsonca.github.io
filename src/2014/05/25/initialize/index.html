<p>I need to write more often.</p>

<p>I blab enough on <a href="http://plus.google.com/+CarlPearson" title="Social media is dumb.">G+</a>,
sure, but the format is too limited.  Limits are useful - they provide creative
focus - but the assorted canned social media options restrict work to one
pretty-print link at a time, or one picture / album at a time.</p>

<p>Also, all I seem to do there is complain about the political situation.  That’s
not healthy; everything is awful, everyone involved is compromised or corrupt,
and we can’t do anything about it.  Anything else I write there is just whinging
about degrees, and that’s not productive.</p>

<p>So, I decided to be productive.  I bought a <a href="http://www.godaddy.com" title="Not the domain I bought, but the DNS provider I bought it from.">domain name</a>.
I’ve been using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for awhile for static sites for
other work, so attaching said domain to my personal Github pages seemed like
the thing to do.</p>

<p>Doing that has provided some inspiration as to subjects, and in this initial post
I’ll tackle how I got this up and running.</p>
