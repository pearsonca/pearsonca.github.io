I need to write more often.

I blab enough on [G+](http://plus.google.com/+CarlPearson "Social media is dumb."),
sure, but the format is too limited.  Limits are useful -- they provide creative
focus -- but the assorted canned social media options restrict work to one
pretty-print link at a time, or one picture / album at a time.

Also, all I seem to do there is complain about the political situation.  That's
not healthy; everything is awful, everyone involved is compromised or corrupt,
and we can't do anything about it.  Anything else I write there is just whinging
about degrees, and that's not productive.

So I decided to be productive.  I bought a [domain name](http://www.godaddy.com "Not the domain I bought, but the DNS provider I bought it from.").
I've been using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for awhile for static sites for
other work, so attaching said domain to my personal Github pages was no big
deal.
